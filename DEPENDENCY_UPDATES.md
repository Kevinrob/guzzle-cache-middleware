  - All 81 tests continue to pass

#### Cache Libraries

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Updates
- Updated `phpunit.xml.dist` schema for PHPUnit 10
- Added `phpstan.neon` configuration file for future static analysis
- Updated dependency constraints to allow modern versions

## Compatibility

### PHP Versions
- Maintained compatibility with PHP 8.1+
- Tested against PHP 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4

### Breaking Changes
- **None**: All updates were done maintaining backward compatibility
- All existing tests pass without modification
- Public API remains unchanged

## Testing Status
- ‚úÖ All 81 tests pass
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ CI workflow compatible with new dependencies
- ‚úÖ Compatible across all supported PHP versions

## Future Considerations

### Static Analysis
- PHPStan configuration added (`phpstan.neon`) but not installed due to network constraints
- Can be installed manually: `composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan`

### Further Updates
- All major dependencies are now at modern versions
- Future updates should be minor/patch versions
- Regular `composer outdated` checks recommended

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run tests
composer test

# Check for security issues
composer audit

# Check for outdated packages
composer outdated

# Validate composer configuration
composer validate
```

## Notes
- The update process prioritized stability and backward compatibility
- Only production-ready, stable versions were selected
- All changes maintain the existing public API
